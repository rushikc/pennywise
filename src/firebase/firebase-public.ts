This file contains the Firebase configuration for the application.
It uses environment variables to set the configuration values.

This configuration is intended for client-side use in a React application,
where Firebase services need to be initialized in the browser.
These configuration values are considered public information and do not
pose a security risk when exposed in client-side code.

Firebase enforces security through:
- Firebase Authentication rules
- Firestore/Database security rules
- Storage security rules
- Project-level API restrictions

For more information on Firebase configuration and security best practices:

- https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api-keys
- https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules
