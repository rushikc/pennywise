## Overview

Pennywise is a comprehensive, open-source web application designed to empower individuals in managing their personal
finances. It provides an intuitive platform to track, categorize, and visualize expenses, helping users gain clear
insights into their spending patterns and achieve financial mastery. Built with modern web technologies, Pennywise offers
a user-friendly experience with robust features, including offline support and secure authentication.

## Features

* 📊 **Expense Tracking**: Easily add, edit, and manage your daily expenses with detailed inputs.
* 📧 **Gmail Integration**: Effortlessly scan your emails to automatically identify and import expense information.
* 🏷️ **Tagging System**: Categorize expenses with custom tags for flexible and granular organization.
* 🤖 **Auto Tagging**: Cloud functions automatically apply tags to new expenses based on previously user-marked
  vendor-tag associations.
* 📅 **Date Filtering**: Filter expenses by various time periods (e.g., 1 day, 7 days, 2 weeks, & more) for focused
  analysis.
* 📊 **Visualization**: Understand spending patterns at a glance through interactive statistical charts and graphs.
* 🔄 **Offline Caching**: Data is cached locally using IndexedDB, to reduce firestore queries, but the app requires
  internet connectivity to function fully.
* 🔒 **Google Authentication**: Secure and convenient login via Google OAuth for user management.

## Demo
- Google Auth & Firestore is disabled in demo app, All the data is stored in a static file to save costs.
- This is a static variation of the website, which means you can explore the app without needing to log in.

## Security and Cost

Pennywise is designed with your data privacy and security as a top priority. Unlike many other financial apps, Pennywise
gives you complete control over your data and infrastructure. Here’s what makes our approach to security different:

* **🔒 You Own Your Data**: Your financial data is yours alone. It is stored in your own Google Firebase Firestore
  instance, not on our servers. You have full control over who can access it.

* **☁️ Self-Hosted on Your Google Cloud**: You deploy Pennywise on your personal Google Cloud project. This means you
  manage the entire infrastructure, ensuring that you are the only one with access to the backend services and database.

* **💸 No Hidden Costs**: Pennywise is open-source and free to use. You only pay for what you use on the Google Cloud
  Platform, which offers a generous free tier for Firebase and Cloud Functions.

* **🚫 No Ads, No Tracking**: Pennywise is a completely ad-free platform. We do not track your behavior or sell your data
  to third parties. Our goal is to provide a tool that helps you manage your finances, not to monetize your personal
  information.

* **📖 Open Source Transparency**: The entire codebase is open-source. You can inspect the code yourself to verify that
  there are no hidden trackers or malicious logic. This transparency ensures that we are accountable to our users.

* **🔐 Secure Authentication**: We use Google OAuth for authentication, which provides a secure and reliable way to log
  in to your account without us ever seeing or storing your password.

* **🔑 Minimal Permissions**: Pennywise requests only the necessary permissions to function. For instance, the Gmail
  integration is designed to only access emails related to financial transactions, ensuring the privacy of your personal
  correspondence.

* **⚙️ You Control Updates**: Since you host the application, you are in full control of when and how you update it. You
  will never be forced into an update that changes the functionality or privacy in a way you don't agree with.

* **🔒 Secured Infrastructure**: All backend services on Google Cloud are protected by Google's authentication mechanisms
  and including the infra exposed public internet. This ensures that only authenticated & your mail id requests from
  your application can access your data and services.

By putting you in control of your data and the application's infrastructure, Pennywise offers a transparent and secure
way to manage your personal finances.

## Architecture

Pennywise is built using a modern front-end architecture with the following key components:

### Overview

1. **User Authentication**:
  - Users authenticate using Google OAuth
2. **Data Fetching**:
  - On app initialization, data is fetched from Firebase Firestore
  - Data is stored locally in IndexedDB for offline access
  - Redux store is populated with expense and tag data
3. **User Interactions**:
  - Users can view, filter, and group expenses
  - New expenses can be added manually or imported
  - Expenses can be tagged for categorization
4. **Data Persistence**:
  - Changes are saved to both IndexedDB and Firebase
  - Data synchronization happens automatically when online

- [ ] Enhancing Insights with more detailed analytics & better graph support grouped category
- [ ] Multi-selected expense tagging feature
- [ ] Expense analysis using historical data (Firebase AI Logic)
- [ ] Expense sharing/tracking between users (Multi user persona)
